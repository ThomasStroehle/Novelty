# AI-based novelty detection in crowdsourced idea spaces

In the following project, we applied different language embeddings (SBert, Ada002, Doc2Vec, SimCSE) to an idea contest to identify novel ideas. For novel detection, we used different unsupervised methods such as local outlier factor and kNN distance and compared our results with human evaluations. All computations and evaluations can be found in the following [notebook](https://github.com/ThomasStroehle/Novelty/blob/main/novelty.ipynb).
